class MCSS:
    """
    Reads and writes MCSS features for a ligand pair.

    There are two key phases of the computation:
        (1) Identification of maximum common substructure(s)
        (2) Computation of RMSDs between the substructures in
            docking results.

    Task (1) is accomplished using Schrodinger's canvasMCSS utility.
    Task (2) is accomplished by identifying all matches of the substructure(s)
    from (1) and finding the pair with the mimimum RMSD. This is a subtlely
    difficult task because of symmetry concerns and details of extracting
    substructures.

    MCSS must be at least half the size of the smaller of the ligands
    or no RMSDs are computed.

    A key design decision is to not specify any file names in this class
    (other than those associated with temp files). The implication of this
    is that MCSSController will be completely in control of this task, while
    this class can be dedicated to actually computing the MCSS feature.
